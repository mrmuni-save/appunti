- ***communicating function***: tell things to others, inform
- ***pleause function***: reading, listening to music, podcasts, even if there is a meaning behind these words)

- ***ideational function*** *includes identifying, reasoning and recording functions*
- ***interpersonal function*** *includes communicating, physiological and phatic functions*
- ***phatic function*** *includes phatic and pleasure functions*
- ***textual function*** *construction of text, may include recording functions or pleasure function*

Functions remain stable: [[#Context|context]] change over time and change the language.

*hail* -> *hello* -> *hi*
*how fare thee* -> *how do you do* -> *how are you* -> *what's up*
