#### A tour of the English accents

In the mid of the 16ᵗʰ century, lots of sounds started to differ between northen England and soutern England, and lots of words and rhymes too.
Example: *cut* was pronounced /cʊt/ everywhere in Britain before 16th century, but then, it started to be pronounced /cʌt/ in the southern England.
The traditional London accent, known as *Cockney*.
Mute T's in middle of words, like *butter* are known as glottal sound.
