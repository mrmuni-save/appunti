#### Vowels of Enlgish (*chapter 9-10 of The Framework Of English book*)

Vowels, unlike consonant are produced by free flow of airstream, and position of tongue, so, unlike consonant, there is no obstruction.
To describe vowel sounds the wowel quadrilateral is used.
There are two fixed articulatory reference points to the system, based on the position of the tip of the tongue: pushed forward and towards the hard palate that makes the \[i] sound, and pushed as far down and back as possible that makes the \[ɑ] sound.

Vertically the positions are called:
- close
- close-mid / half-close
- mid
- open-mid / half-open
- open
Horizontally the positions are called:
- front
- central
- back
By lips position:
- unrounded / spread *like /ɪ/*
- neutral *like /ə/*
- rounded *like /ɔ/*

The quadrilateral of the cardinal vowels has been invented by Daniel Jones, the same inventor of RP, and author of *The Pronunciation of English*.
In English the long vowels are indicated by the diacritics */**ː**/*.
if a wowel does not have diacritics then it is a short wowel, such as */**ɪ**/*. 
*Example: \<cheap> -> \[chiːp] vs \<chip> -> \[chɪp]*.
The most occurring wowel sound in english is the schwa /ə/, but it only can be found in unstressed syllables.
*Examples:*
- **a**bout
- syst**e**m
- eas**i**ly
- gall**o**p
- circ**u**s

The 20 vowel sounds of RP are quantitatively divided into short vowels, long vowels and diphtongs.

teacher -> alveolar plosive voiceless t, front close long unrounded i, plosive affricate voiceless tʃ, mid centre unstressed unrounded ə -> /'tiːtʃə/ -> /ti-tʃə/
kitchen -> veolar plosive voiceless k, front close short unrounded i, plosive affricate voiceless tʃ, front close short unrounded i, n -> /'kɪtʃɪn/
work -> /wɜːk/ -> ɜ: half-open central unrounded long
cinema -> fricative alveolar voiceless s, front close short unrounded i, nasal alveolar voiceless n, mid centre unstressed ə, bilabial nasal voiced m, mid centre unstressedə -> /'sɪnəmə/
who -> /huː/
book -> /bʊk/ ʊ half close back rounded
car -> ka: -> monosyllabic
study
ball
hat
pen
