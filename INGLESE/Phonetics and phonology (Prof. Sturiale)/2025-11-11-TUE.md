#### Diphthongs or compound vowels

Some vowels are described as diphthongs, but diphthongs are a single sound.
These, glide from one vowel sound to anther, and involve a change in the position of the tongue.
The first part of the sound is always stronger than the second part.

There are more types of diphthongs:
- centring -> glides towards central vowel (ə)
- closing -> glides towards a close vowel

Variants are different pronunciations allowed in RP. An example may be the word *sure* that ma be pronounced both /sɔ:/ and /sɒ:/ (like *suit* vs *shore*).
