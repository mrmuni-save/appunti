#### The vocal tract

The vocal tract is where the sounds are produced.
The vocal tract is composed by:
- oesophagus
- trachea
- larynx (includes vocal chords)
- tongue
	- tip
	- blade
	- front
	- back
	- root

During speech, the air ***flows from the lungs via the trachea and into the larynx*** (*voice box*).
The flow of air is called airstream, and it can be
- egressive (if it goes out)
- ingressive (if it goes in)

When describing a consonant it must have to be taken into account where in the vocal tract the obstruction is made, defining an ***active articulator***, which moves towards, and a ***passive articulator***, which is in a fixed position.
*Phonetic symbols have to be written in square brackets*.

#### Consonants in RP

Consonants are speech sounds produced through a temporary closure (partial or complete) of the vocal tract.
In RP there are 24 consonants.
Most of the symbols used to represent these sounds are the same as the ones in the Roman alphabet, while some are from Greek alphabet.
To describe a consonant it must be described the nature of the obstruction.
There are three key factors to be taken into consideration:
- voicing
- place of articulation
- manner of articulation

*For example, the "m" sound is made with the lips (bilabial), air escapes from the nose (nasal), and it is said with voice (voiced); while the "t" sound is made with the tongue-tip against the teeth-ridge (alveoral), the air does not escape from the nose but only from mouth (oral), and it is said without voice (voiceless)*.

Places of articulation:
- bilabials (usage of lips)
- labiodentals (usage of lips and teeth)
- interdentals/dentals (usage of tongue-tip and teeth)
- alveolars (usage of tongue-tip and alveolars)
- postalveolars
- palato-alveolars
- palatals
- velars
- glottals

Manner of articulation:
- plosives (airstream stopped, can't be long)
- fricatives (partial blockage of airstream, resulting in friction, continuant)
- affricates (combination of a brief blockage of the airstream with an obstructed release which causes some friction)
- nasals (airstream goes out from the nose, soft palate is lowered and airstream continues to flow)
- laterals (air passes through the mouth along the sides of the tongue and not the centre)
- approximates (similar to vocal sound)
