#### Conditionals:

zero conditional: if present - present -> facts
first conditional: if present - future
second conditional: if past - would -> not likely to happen
third conditional: past perfect + past conditional -> unreal in the past, so impossible as the possibility/chance is already gone

could = would be able to
might = mind the possibility / consider it
